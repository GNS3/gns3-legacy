INSTALLATION

 * Here are the dependencies of GNS-3:

 	- Qt >= 4.2
 	- Python >= 2.4
 	- Sip >= 4.5
 	- PyQt >= 4.1

 * WINDOWS users:

	1. Download http://www.gns3.net/chrome/site/pyqt-gns3-setup.exe (~22 MB)
   
	This program will install multiple programs that GNS-3 and Dynamips depends on:

 		- WinPCAP 4.0
 		- Dynamips 0.2.7
 		- Python 2.5.1
 		- PyQt 4.2                   
 		- MinGW dll and Qt 4.3 dlls.

	2. Run pyqt-gns3-setup.exe and follow the prompts. You will be asked to reboot your PC at the end.

	3. Configure the integrated hypervisor by double-clicking on gns3-config.pyw (Optional if you want to start dynamips in hypervisor mode yourself).

	4. Start GNS-3 by double-clicking on gns3.pyw.

 * Linux users:

 	- If you are on debian/ubuntu, use apt-get install python-qt4 to install the dependencies and start GNS-3 by double-clicking on gns3.pyw.


 * MacOS X users:

	1. Download python 2.5.1 for Macintosh OS X on http://www.python.org/download/ and install it.

	2. Download qt-mac-opensource-4.3.0.dmg on http://trolltech.com/developer/downloads/qt/mac and install it

	3. PyQt

	4. Start GNS-3 by double-clicking on gns3.pyw.


CURRENT LIMITATIONS

Those limitations will be corrected in future releases.

 * Currently the symbols are purely decorative, meaning there isn't any difference between them.
 * Ethernet links are drawn whether you choose a serial or Ethernet interface.

TODO LIST

 * Provide a way to do get a IDLE PC directly from GNS-3 and include/reuse an IDLE PC database.
 * Use the ghost file and sparsemen features
 * Option to suspend and resume IOS.
 * Enable the use of iomem
 * Use virtual ATM, Frame-Relay, Ethernet switches and the NIO bridge module provided by Dynamips
 * Language support.
 * Configuration of network modules dynamically when linking to other nodes.
 * Users can change hostnames
 * NET files import and export
 * Connections to real NICs
 * Include a Close option and a New option on the File menu
 * Provide a way to select multiple devices to configure at the same time in Node Configuration. Right now, you have to configure each router separately.
 * Provide a all-in-one package for Windows users.
 * Do a slow 'start all IOS'
 * Use the fast clock divisor of Dynamips.
 * Add more 'Cisco-like' SVG symbols.

OPEN ISSUES

 * How about a telnet all button?
 * On Windows, all telnet windows have the same window title bar "Telnet localhost"
 * How can we get the status of an interface from the IOS?
