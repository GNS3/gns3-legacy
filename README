 	- Python >= 2.4
 	- Sip >= 4.5
 	- PyQt >= 4.1

 * WINDOWS users:

	1. Download GNS3 all-in-one for Windows on http://www.gns3.net (~23 MB)
   
	This program will install GNS-3, Dynamips and multiple programs that them depends on:

 		- WinPCAP 4.0
 		- Dynamips 0.2.7
 		- Python 2.5.1
 		- PyQt 4.2
 		- MinGW dll and Qt 4.3 dlls.

	2. Run it and follow the prompts. You will be asked to reboot your PC at the end.

	3. Configure the integrated hypervisor by double-clicking on gns3-config.pyw (Optional if you want to start dynamips in hypervisor mode yourself).

	4. Start GNS-3 by double-clicking on gns3.pyw.

 * Linux users:

 	- If you are on debian/ubuntu, use apt-get install python-qt4 to install the dependencies and start GNS-3 by double-clicking on gns3.pyw or launching it from a command line.


 * MacOS X users:

CURRENT LIMITATIONS

Those limitations will be corrected in future releases.

 * Currently the symbols are purely decorative, meaning there isn't any difference between them.
 * Ethernet links are drawn whether you choose a serial or Ethernet interface.

TODO LIST

 * Provide a way to do get a IDLE PC directly from GNS-3 and include/reuse an IDLE PC database.
 * Use the ghost file and sparsemen features
 * Option to suspend and resume IOS.
 * Enable the use of iomem
 * Use virtual ATM, Frame-Relay, Ethernet switches and the NIO bridge module provided by Dynamips
 * Language support.
 * Configuration of network modules dynamically when linking to other nodes.
 * Users can change hostnames
 * NET files import and export
 * Connections to real NICs
 * Include a Close option and a New option on the File menu
 * Provide a way to select multiple devices to configure at the same time in Node Configuration. Right now, you have to configure each router separately.
 * Do a slow 'start all IOS'
 * Use the fast clock divisor of Dynamips.
 * Add more 'Cisco-like' SVG symbols.
 * An all-in-one installer for Mac OS X
 * Show interface names on the scene (as an option).
 * Correct minor drawing problems with the status points.
 * Warn users when configuration changes in the node affect links

OPEN ISSUES

 * How about a telnet all button?
 * On Windows, all telnet windows have the same window title bar "Telnet localhost", alternate solution: using putty
 * How can we get the status of an interface from the IOS?
