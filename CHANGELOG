GNS3 0.7RC1

 * Qemu integration.
 * JunOS & ASA integration using Qemu.
 * An undo/redo framework (unstable).

GNS3 0.6.1

Improvements:

 * Copy an inserted image in the project's working directory and update its path in the .net file.
 * Prevent auto-generated interface notes to be recorded in the .net file.
 * Display an error msg box if a working directory can't be used by an hypervisor. 
 * Check if a hostname has already been used when creating a new node.
 * Warn to use manual links when a user select a NM-16ESW module.
 * Check if GNS3 is running on a Windows 64 bits OS in order to choose the correct path to Putty. 
 * Check IOS and working directories paths when creating new nodes and throw a warning to the user if something is wrong.
 * Button to edit project settings.

Fixes:

 * Prevent notes to be deleted when typing the delete key while editing.
 * Prevent NM-16ESW modules to be removed from routers when using Ethernet/FastEthernet links.
 * Tooltips update when starting/stopping/suspending routers.
 * Bug with Qt 4.5 on selected filter when openning a project (getOpenFileName) 
 * 99MB limit for pcmcia disks. 
 * Unicode errors with TMP env variable on Windows. 
 * AttributeError: value of `chassis' must be of type string.
 * Merge correct config paths when loading a .net create on a different platform.

GNS3 0.6

 * Users can change the workspace size.
 * Possibility to draw rectangles and ellipses.
 * Feature to automatically create labels of interface names.
 * Multi-links drawing (no overlaps).
 * Snapshot feature.
 * Interface names are included in the Generic Ethernet NIO list on Windows.
 * New export to images (JPEG, PNG ...) that allows to export all the workspace (and not only what you see).
 * "Expand all" and "collapse all" features for the topology summary panel (contribution by beduev).
 * Annotations, rectangles and ellipses can be rotated.
 * On Windows, users can load an alternative gns3.ini by setting a path on command line, example: gns3.exe --configdir <path_to_dir_containing_gns3.ini>

GNS3 0.5:

 * Possibility to load .net files of other users (provided that there is a registered IOS image with the same model as the one used in the NET file).
 * New detailed tooltips for nodes. 
 * A minimalist wizard raised when the configuration file is empty.
 * A button to insert a picture on the scene.
 * Decorative node support for creating network diagrams.
 * Ghostios is now supported on remote hypervisors.
 * A symbol manager with library support (a howto to create a symbol library will be released).
 * Z values can be changed for annotations and inserted pictures.
 * Automatic load-balancing on external hypervisors (choose multiple external hypervisors when recording an IOS image).
 * New option to bind the hypervisor manager with an address/name other than 'localhost': useful for labs which use local and remote hypervisors.
