 * New SecureCRT command line for OSX in terminal settings preferences.
 * A 500ms delay has been added when consoling to more than one device at the same time.
 * Qemu <-> VBox linking has been fixed.
 * FlexiNetwork VirtualBox feature had been patched.
 * Italian translation has been updated.
 * Give a chance to hypervisor/wrapper processes to stop before they get killed.
 * An issue when trying to choose the file in the Startup-Config dialog has been fixed.

 * New icons with fancy hover effects (start, stop, pause, ellipse and rectangle).
 * Farsi, Czech, Japanese and Italian translations updated.
 * GNS3 settings file (gns3.ini) can be put in the same folder as gns3.exe (Windows only). This allows GNS3 to be standalone on USB stick for instance.
 * New host device: a cloud with the ‘computer’ symbol and configured with all host interfaces.
 * Qemu mac address generator has been fixed.
 * Access to VirtualBox Manager from the GUI.
 * Soft link gns3 -> gns3.pyw has been added (Unix/Linux only).
 * Changed default paths for wrappers on OSX and UNIX/Linux.
 * Wrappers are now GPL licensed.
 * PEMU binary has been removed from our sources (it is still available on our download page).
 * Capture option is now available from the “Device” contextual menu.
 * Link actions are available from the summary topology window pane.
 * Show rpcap interface names in a tooltip when hovering an entry in the interface menu (Windows only).
 * Qemuwrapper support for the new Qemu networking syntax.

 * Small improvements and bug fixes all over the place.

GNS3 0.8.2 BETA - 12.12.2011.

 * Official integration of VirtualBox Edition features.
 * Auto-update checker / notifier (by default disabled on Linux, BSD, enabled on Mac and Windows).
 * Qemu got a predictable MAC address pseudo-random number generator (brezular’s case).
 * VirtualBox interface numbering match VBox VM vNics numbering – VBox ethernet adapter now starts counting with “e2″, instead of “e0″ to remove confusion with VBox GUI. (this change may break existing topologies, so people will need to manually edit them. Making automatic converter is too problematic.)
 * Windows version is now pre-compiled. (like in v0.7.x), 64-bit version is introduced.
 * Windows all-in-one package includes Wireshark.
 * Windows all-in-one package allows you to choose between 32-bit and 64-bit versions.
 * Live Capture is now enabled by default on all platforms.
 * Fixed screenshots (enabled Qt 4.7.x library in GNS3 + shipped Qt 4.7.4 on Windows)
 * Dynagen: Fixed standalone text-mode / CLI operation.
 * Fixed QemuManager, which failed to start qemuwrapper.py (Windows XP hosts only).
 * Main: should start from relative paths now.
 * GUI: Hide display window errors fixed.
 * GUI: got new ‘Device’ menu mirroring contextual menu (right-click on a device).
 * GNS3 version is saved in topology files.
 * Many small GUI improvements all over the place. (RedNectar’s wishes).
 * Improvements for setup Wizard and first time users.
 * Reverted GUI limit to hide Linux options (VDE, NIO_Linux, KVM) due to use case: Windows GUI + Linux server.
 * Experimental:  layers < 0 are now considered background layers. Only annotations, pictures and shaped items can be on a background layer. Once on a background layer, an item cannot be selected and moved anymore. However they still can be individually selected why right-click.

 * PCAP capture support for Qemu based devices (Qemu host, JunOS ASA, PIX, IDS). This option cannot be used after the selected device is started.
 * Fixed many issues with the snapshot feature. Now it should work as expected.
 * New node type: EtherSwitch router. This is a c3700 router with a Etherswitch NM-16ESW loaded.
 * Better consistency between buttons and menus. Many items have been renamed, toolbar buttons accessible from the menu etc.

 * Option to replace unknown IOS image when loading a NET file.
 * Scroll the scene with the mouse middle click or right and left clicks a the same time. This behavior is to be changed in a future release.
