TODO LIST

GUI

 * Add a Clear startup configuration button and/or add a Clear All Startup configurations option to the control menu.
 * Style options for node labels.
 * Option to draw dummy lines and arrows on the scene (http://forum.gns3.net/topic6622.html)
 * Create more 'Show advanced options' where there are too many options in Preferences.
 * New logo for GNS3?
 * Snap to grid would be a great option to align all routers in fixed and neat location
 * Ability to change and set a font type to be the default for all your projects (including interface font size and type)
 * Ability to centralise fonts (i.e description inside a project), align to the left, or align to the right (similar to notepad/Word)
 * Ability to slightly change the colour or shades of the routers to add more customisable options (blue-ish colour would be nice).
 * Ability to display the link bandwidth (right click then display bandwidth) which is read from the startup-config/running-config. I don't know how easy this can be, but studying routing and knowing what bandwidth each link, makes understanding routing protocols more interesting.
 * Activity lights (http://forum.gns3.net/topic5026.html)
 * Different color for link to match the Ethernet speed.
 * Animation to represent traffic activity? (http://forum.gns3.net/topic5257.html)
 * Hide/Show specific Map Layers (http://forum.gns3.net/topic5077.html)
 * IOS Images and hypervisors need rewriting (http://forum.gns3.net/topic5158.html)

OSX

 * Open .net files from Finder on Mac OS X (http://www.gns3.net/phpBB/topic1817.html)
 * DMG installer for Mac OS X (http://chromasoft.blogspot.com/2010/02/building-dmg-installer-for-mac-simple.html)

Dynamips

 * NIO Multicast support, is this useful? 
 * Set system ID (can be useful for pageant IOS)
 * Automatic console login for IOS (idlepc is not effective until hitting returns in the IOS console), use expect scripts? (Putty/SecureCRT/TeraTerm have custom scripts that do this now).
 * Auto UDP: to simplify the UDP port mapping stuff and the binding problems that can occur
 	-> The first command to use is: "nio create_udp_auto <nio_name> <local_addr> <local_port_start> <local_port_end>"
 	-> It will return the allocated port number. local_addr is an IPv4/IPv6 address (0.0.0.0 on IPv4 and :: on IPv6 to listen on all addresses). local_port_start and local_port_end define a port range (it can be useful if you are behind a firewall).
	-> On the remote side: nio connect_udp_auto <nio_name> <remote_host> <remote_port>
    -> remote_host being the host where nio create_udp_auto was called, and remote_port the port number returned by it.

Client/Server

 * Dynamips Management Server intended for teaching environments (not need to share an IOS image).
 * Client/Server protocol should become asynchronous, so for instance users won't wait until all VMs actually start.

Misc.

 * Ostinato integration? (http://ostinato.org)
 * Load custom flash files (e.g. with cme etc.)
 * Device startup order with delay (http://forum.gns3.net/topic7000.html)
 * The add-a-link tool to recognise special EtherSwitch Routers (http://forum.gns3.net/topic6760.html)
 * Notes to support hyperlinks (http://forum.gns3.net/topic6621.html).
 
Bugs.

 * c1700 not recognised (http://forum.gns3.net/topic6953.html)

Misc. (by Technologov)

 * Investigate possibility of GuestIP address retrieval from Dynamips Routers by means of SNMP 
     (+pre-configured SNMP startup-config + management interface)
 * libguestfs to read filesystem within Qemu/KVM guests.

GNS3 related feature requests in 3rd party products: (by Technologov)

 * Qt4: [feature-request] Please add new GUI container element, that shows/hides others, "QIArrowButtonSwitch" (QTBUG-19984)
 * VirtualBox: serial port TCP / Telnet listener (Wish #1851)
 * VirtualBox: Direct Linux Boot (required for ASA guests; Wish #8401)
 * VirtualBox: PEMU key+serial injection (required for PIX guests)
 * VirtualBox: [feature-request] Please support 16 vNICs per VM (Wish #8805)
 * VirtualBox: [feature-request] GuestControl execute must automatically handle extensions, like shell does (Wish #9035)
 * VirtualBox: [feature-request] Guest Additions: Please provide clipboard copy paste for text-mode console VMs (without X.org) (Wish #9291) (jarle's case)

GNS3 related bugs in 3rd party products: (by Technologov)

 * VirtualBox: Guest IP retrieval works incorrectly if you have several IP addresses on the same NIC (bug #9006)
 * VirtualBox: Only first 4 out of 8 ethernet cards work with Windows XP guest (bug #8772)
 * VirtualBox: Critical bug(!!!): VBoxSVC locks up on Windows XP hosts; reproducible with my vboxtestcase.py
    (happens on VM stop and on netadp disable.) (VBox bug #9239)
    This leads to GNS3 lock-ups and crashes.
 * VirtualBox: GuestControl execution from python fails on Windows hosts. (Bug #9295)
