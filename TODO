TODO LIST

 * Open .net files from Finder on Mac OS X (http://www.gns3.net/phpBB/topic1817.html)
 * NIO Multicast support (next release of Dynamips)
 * Auto UDP (next release of Dynamips)
 * WICS removable (next release of Dynamips)
 * Packet capture between Qemu devices
 * Do not remove original comments in .net files

Debugging

 * Can only run one instance of Qemu on Windows (http://www.gns3.net/phpBB/topic1914.html)
 * Snapshots should have the same directory layout as projects
 * Dynamic FR/ATM/ATMBR mapping modification
 * Change a symbol for a device
 * Built-in symbols should be loaded even if not in the node list
 * Interface label should be restored
 * When creating a topology from another one, the configs should be copied
 * Remove associated config when deleting a device.
 
 File > New Blank Project which
a) warns that the current topology will be cleared and then
b) (after confirmation) do just that Ð clear the topology and start a new blank project in the directory you create by naming your project. [Note: I'm writing another post that relates to this comment - the Case for a new standard naming convention for configs and working directories - look out for that in a few days]
