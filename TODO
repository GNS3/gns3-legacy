 * NIO multicast support (next release of Dynamips)
 * Show NIO activity (next release of Dynamips)
 * Dynamips QinQ integration (next release of Dynamips)
 * Vmware integration (http://www.gns3.net/phpBB/topic1162.html) => see VIX API and pyvix
 * VirtualBox integration?
 * Cpulimit integration => no need to integrate, use a script to start Qemu followed by cpulimit
 * Check ghostios  ==> It works, virtual mem usage is ok (at least on Mac OS X).
