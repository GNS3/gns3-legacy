TODO LIST

Qemu/Pemu

 * Extract/write files from Qemu qcow2 format image files using libguestfs
 * Implement Qemu monitor functions (need to update the Qemu patch)
 * VNC support for Qemu (-vnc 127.0.0.1:i++) + entry in the contextual memu to start VNC

GUI

 * Add an Open Recent option to the file menu, lists say last 6 projects.
 * Add a Clear Configuration button to the startup configuration option, and/or add a Clear All Configurations option to the control menu.
 * Style options for node labels
 * Change the scrolling behavior for the scene
 * Improved "baseconfig.txt" message => "The Base config: file specified in Edit->IOS Images and hypervisors [IOS Images] (%filename) for image %imagename can not be found; no such file or directory. Your router will start with a blank configuration."
 * Option to draw a line or draw an arrow on the scene
 * Copy feature for Dynagen console
 * Dynamic notes

Dynamips

 * NIO Multicast support, is this useful? (supported only in dynamips-community version) 
 * Set system ID.
 * Automatic console login for IOS (idlepc is not effective until hitting returns in the IOS console)
 * Auto UDP (supported in dynamips-community): to simplify the UDP port mapping stuff and the binding problems that can occur
 	-> The first command to use is: "nio create_udp_auto <nio_name> <local_addr> <local_port_start> <local_port_end>"
 	-> It will return the allocated port number. local_addr is an IPv4/IPv6 address (0.0.0.0 on IPv4 and :: on IPv6 to listen on all addresses). local_port_start and local_port_end define a port range (it can be useful if you are behind a firewall).
	-> On the remote side: nio connect_udp_auto <nio_name> <remote_host> <remote_port>
    -> remote_host being the host where nio create_udp_auto was called, and remote_port the port number returned by it.

Client/Server

 * Dynamipswrapper for remote labs (not need to share an IOS image)

Import/Export

 * Open .net files from Finder on Mac OS X (http://www.gns3.net/phpBB/topic1817.html)
 * Do not remove original comments in .net files.
 * Drag'n'drop a .net topology inside GNS3
 * .net versioning

Misc.

 * New logo for GNS3
 * Check for new version at startup, ask for download.
 * DMG installer for Mac OS X (http://chromasoft.blogspot.com/2010/02/building-dmg-installer-for-mac-simple.html)
 * Only one location for VERSION constant (in setup.py)

(by Technologov)
 * Real Cisco icons, including the various cards out there (like Cisco Packet Tracer does)
     Not on topology -- but in Node configuration options.
 * Link Packet loss + delay (like Marionnet does)
 * Built-in Exercises + Labs (like Boson NetSim does)
 * backward-and-forward format compatibility (GNS3 format + dynagen topology format)
     That is: topology importing fails, when GNS3 topology was made with newer version of software, and imported with older. (like Marionnet does)
     Should ignore unknown parameters for import with older versions;
     Should provide default parameters for import with newer versions;
 * Client/Server protocol must become asynchronoous, so ppl won't wait until all VMs actually start (like Marionnet does)
 * Investigate possibility of GuestIP address retrieval from Dynamips Routers by means of SNMP 
     (+pre-configured SNMP startup-config + management interface)
 * Consider Quagga integration, like "VisualNetKit" does
 * Automatic Network Topology Generator, like "AutoNetkit" does

Code Refactoring

REMOVAL of:
1. *Defaults.py (can be merged into *Devices.py ?)
2. initialization scripts may be merged: gns3.pyw + main.py + application.py (main.py might be merged either into application.py or into gns3.pyw)

Cleanup:
3. DynagenSub.py: open_config() -- one *huge* function.
This is import/export code, but it is very ugly/unreadable. Spaghetti code, which is very hard to debug and understand.
It needs to be broken up into smaller functions, that are readable and easy to debug.
(I afraid to touch this code, because I don't understand it fully, and I may break features)

Debugging

 * Duplicated packets with ETHSW?
 * Test QinQ
 * PIX booting with 256M RAM?! => 128 Minimum
 * Unicode error with PIX

GNS3-Related feature-requests in 3rd party products: (by Technologov)

 * Wireshark: Wish 5982 - Feature-request: Please support live-capture from saved pcap file
 * IPv6 support for our engines: VirtualBox / Qemu / Dynamips
 * Qemu: Push Qemu UDP patch upstream
 * Qt4: [feature-request] Please add new GUI container element, that shows/hides others, "QIArrowButtonSwitch" (QTBUG-19984)
 * VirtualBox: serial port TCP / Telnet listener (Wish #1851)
 * VirtualBox: Direct Linux Boot (required for ASA guests; Wish #8401)
 * VirtualBox: PEMU key+serial injection (required for PIX guests)
 * VirtualBox: [feature-request] Please support 16 vNICs per VM (Wish #8805)

GNS3-Related bugs in 3rd party products: (by Technologov)

 * VirtualBox: Guest IP retrieval works incorrectly if you have several IP addresses on the same NIC (bug #9006)
 * VirtualBox: Only first 4 out of 8 ethernet cards work with Windows XP guest (bug #8772)
 * FIXED: VirtualBox: Duplicate MAC addresses on import/export OVF appliance and clone VM (UldisD's case; bug #9074)
 * VirtualBox: Critical bug(!!!): VBoxSVC locks up on Windows XP hosts; reproducible with my vboxtestcase.py
    (happens on VM stop and on netadp disable.) (VBox bug #9239)
    This leads to GNS3 lock-ups and crashes.
 * VirtualBox: GuestControl execution from python fails on Windows hosts. (Bug #9295)
