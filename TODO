TODO LIST

 * Open .net files from Finder on Mac OS X (http://www.gns3.net/phpBB/topic1817.html)
 * DMG installer for Mac OS X (http://chromasoft.blogspot.com/2010/02/building-dmg-installer-for-mac-simple.html)
 * NIO Multicast support, is this useful? (supported only in dynamips-community version)
 * VirtualBox integration (patch VirtualBox to support UDP tunnels + create a VBoxWrapper).
 * VNC support for Qemu (-vnc 127.0.0.1:i++) + entry in the contextual memu to start VNC
 * Implement Qemu monitor functions (need to update the Qemu patch)
 * Style options for node labels
 * Do not remove original comments in .net files.
 * A "Open recent files" menu.
 * New logo for GNS3
 * Change the scrolling behavior for the scene
 * Extract/write files from Qemu qcow2 format image files using libguestfs
 * Dynamipswrapper for remote labs (not need to share an IOS image)
 * Auto-detection of a newer GNS3 version available to download
 * Drag'n'drop a .net topology inside GNS3
 * Option to draw a line or draw an arrow on the scene
 * Set system ID.
 * Automatic console login for IOS (idlepc is not effective until hitting returns in the IOS console)
 * Auto UDP (supported in dynamips-community): to simplify the UDP port mapping stuff and the binding problems that can occur
 	-> The first command to use is: "nio create_udp_auto <nio_name> <local_addr> <local_port_start> <local_port_end>"
 	-> It will return the allocated port number. local_addr is an IPv4/IPv6 address (0.0.0.0 on IPv4 and :: on IPv6 to listen on all addresses). local_port_start and local_port_end define a port range (it can be useful if you are behind a firewall).
	-> On the remote side: nio connect_udp_auto <nio_name> <remote_host> <remote_port>
    -> remote_host being the host where nio create_udp_auto was called, and remote_port the port number returned by it.

Debugging

 * Screenshots appear to be broken in latest Qt (4.7.x)
 * Duplicated packets with ETHSW?
 * Test QinQ
 * Removable WICs
