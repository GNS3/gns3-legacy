I have my Working directory for Qemu and Dynamips both set to /tmp

My project is saved in /home/brezular/CCNP-work/SWITCH/Test1

When I run project second time I get error message "204-chdir: No such file or directory

It is because it is used Relative path in net file (workingdir = test1_working)

Why does GNS3 use relative path if the base path is NOT the same as the .net file?

def KillAll(process_names):
  """Tries to kill all copies of each process in the processes list."""
  for process_name in process_names:
    Kill(process_name)

def Kill(process_name):
  command = ['taskkill.exe', '/f', '/t', '/im']
  subprocess.call(command + [process_name])
