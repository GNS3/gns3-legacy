 File > New Blank Project which
a) warns that the current topology will be cleared and then
b) (after confirmation) do just that Ð clear the topology and start a new blank project in the directory you create by naming your project. [Note: I'm writing another post that relates to this comment - the Case for a new standard naming convention for configs and working directories - look out for that in a few days]
