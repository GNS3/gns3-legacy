TODO LIST

 * Simulated host support (inspirated from LWIP).
 * A standalone server to automatically configure GNS3 clients in order to use remote hypervisors (intended for learning environments, schools/universities, where IOS images cannot be distributed)
 * NIO multicast support.
 * Show NIO activity.
 * Dynamips QinQ integration.
 * Daisy chaining for switches.
 * Qemu integration.
 * ASA8 support (need to merge Pemu and Qemu).
 * Scene size option.
