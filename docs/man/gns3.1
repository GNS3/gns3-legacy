.Sh DESCRIPTION
GNS3 is a graphical network simulator that allows simulation of
complex networks and to launch simulations on them. It is an excellent
complementary tool to real labs for administrators of Cisco networks
or people wanting to pass their CCNA, CCNP, CCIP or CCIE certifications.
It can also be used to experiment features of Cisco IOS or to check
configurations that need to be deployed later on real routers.
.Pp
To allow complete simulations, GNS3 is strongly linked with :
.Bl -bullet -offset 1c

Dynamips, the core program that allows Cisco IOS emulation
.It
Dynagen, a text-based front-end for Dynamips
.It
Qemu, a generic and open source machine emulator and virtualizer
